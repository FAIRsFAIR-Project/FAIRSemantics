# FAIR Semantics

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository supporting the work carried out by the FAIRsFAIR FAIR Semantics Task. The goal of the Task 2.2 of the FAIRsFAIR project is to establish a set of recommendations and good practices for making semantic artefacts FAIR.

The term "semantic artefact" is being used here as a catchall term covering ontologies, KOS (Knowledge Organization Systems), and any other similar ‘tools’ which allow researchers and machines to describe, locate, access, and understand (meta)data. This could also include data vocabularies, code, code lists, and standards.  

### Context, objectives and scope
The publication of the first set of recommendations for FAIR Semantics is available here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3707984

## How to contribute
Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Each specific issue/thread deals with a different reccomendation. Our goal is to gather consensus about each reccomendation in order to arrive at a set of commonly agreed (and adopted) reccomendations as part of an iteritive process. Please navigate through the issues and comment to give your opinion about the reccomendation(s) you believe need further work.  

It is also possible to submit problems encountered, suggestions, questions, reccomendation proposals etc. as issues.
